# just-plot-it
An attempt to make data plotting as easy as possible

# Why another online tool for plotting?
Many times I just had several comma separated lines from scripts and wanted to plot them. Other online tools ask to put
all values one by one or load csv file. It is too long for such simple thing.

I wanted to make sure that with this tool you will the the result after ctrl-v and 2-3 mouse clicks.
